In this file, I am using print statements enclosed in brackets with quotation marks around my statements so that when it runs through python it will print what I placed in quotes. In these quotes, I have answered some questions from class including what my name is, what my favorite game is, what concerns I have about this class, what I'm excited about, my stackoverflow.com user number, and my URL to my GitHub profile. These statements will print seperately and will be listed in the aforementioned order. 

There's also a link included to brighten your day.
